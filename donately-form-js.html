          <a href="http://dntly.com/api#form-js">Donately Form.js</a> lets you put a secure donation form on any webpage. It can be embedded with only a single line of code and uses a secure connection.
        <p>

        <code>
          &lt;script src='https://www.dntly.com/assets/js/v1/form.js' data-donately-id='11'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          (You can see a live example of this Form.js code embedded at the bottom of this page.)
        </p>

        <p>
          I proposed the idea of Donately Form.js, the Donately team and I worked out the merits and details of creating such a tool, and we got to work creating it. I handled all the programming - solving multiple challenges in building such a tool and working closely with a UI designer that directed the design and styling.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is proving a powerful tool - especially for 501(3)(c) organizations that want to accept donations from their main website, but don't have the development team to implement a custom donation form. Additionally, by using Donately Form.js those organizations glean a great deal of metadata about their donors provided by <a href="http://donately.com">Donately</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>Technologies include:</p>

        <ul class="disc">
          <li>Heavy use of JavaScript</li>
          <li>Custom iFrame</li>
          <li>SSL</li>
          <li>HTML5 postMessage</li>
          <li>Authorize.net</li>
          <li>Stripe</li>
          <li>PayPal</li>
          <li>Heroku</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Below is the embedded Form.js. You can try it out, but use a fake credit card number - unless you really want to send me a payment.</p>
